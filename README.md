## Pros of TDD
Test Driven Development (TDD) involves writing tests first, then the code required to pass the tests. One benefit of this method of development is it encourages modular code since the tests written to be passed are often small. It also encourages taking small steps when developing software, allowing for each component to be of higher quality. For a project that was developed with TDD methodology, maintenance and refactoring of the code will be easier in the long run. This is due to the functionality being completely covered by the tests originally set up from the beginning, allowing maintainers to be confident in how code changes affect the functionality of the system.

## Cons of TDD
Along with the benefits outlined above, some shortcomings also come from the use of TDD. Firstly, the tests themselves may be difficult to write, particularly tests more complex than just unit tests. This would cause development to be slow initially as tests need to be written first for all the desired functionality. Because of its relative novelty, TDD may be difficult to adopt for an entire team, and for each particular member of a team to completely change their work habits to conform to TDD.
